## About The Project
It's a so-called weekender project. Simple one-page website about photography. I wanted to help my colleague with her first steps in photography. She always wanted to have a portfolio online.
## Demo
<a href='dankadzurisovaphotography.netlify.app/'>Link to website</a>

## How I worked on this project
- Semantic HTML and focus on accessibility

- Responsive CSS using modern css syntax

- W3C CSS and HTML Validators to identify errors in markup

- Images have been optimized to 2 different formats.

- Parcel bundler helped me minify files and increase website performance

- I used feature branches and Pull Requests

- I followed Lighhouse advice regarding SEO, best practices and performance

## Why I built the project this way
In simple projects like this one, HTML, CSS, JS are the best tools for the job. It was a good chance to cement basic knowlegde and git commands.
